<h1>Preparing Active-Directory Infrastructure in the cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />



<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (22H2)

<h2>Overview of Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- üîß Create a VM that will act as the Windows Server (Domain Controller)
- üíª Create another VM with Windows 10 ‚Äî this will act as the client machine
- üåê Join the Windows 10 VM to the domain that the Windows Server manages
- üë§ Log in to the Windows 10 client using domain credentials
- üß™ This setup simulates a real environment with a domain controller and a connected client


<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

<h3>Create Resource Group</h3>

<p>We‚Äôre gonna start by creating a resource group called Active-Directory-Lab. This will hold all the resources we‚Äôll be using for our Active Directory lab setup.</p>

<p>Choose the region closest to you and make sure to stick with that same region throughout the entire project to keep things consistent.</p>

<h3>Create a Virtual Network</h3>

<p>Next, we‚Äôll create a Virtual Network. While the VM setup wizard can create one for us automatically, we‚Äôre just gonna go ahead and create it ourselves to have more control over the setup.</p>

<p>We're going to name it Active-Directory-Vnet. Like I mentioned earlier, make sure to choose the same region you picked for the resource group; switching regions can cause issues later on, so it‚Äôs best to stay consistent from the start.</p>

<h3>Create the Virtual Machine for the Domain Controller</h3>

<p>Now we‚Äôre gonna create the VM that‚Äôll act as our domain controller. For the name, we're gonna call it dc-1, for the image, pick Windows Server 2022 Datacenter. For the size, go with Standard_D2s_v3, it has 2 vCPUs and 8 GiB of memory, which is more than enough for this project. For the login, set the username to labuser and the password to Cyberlab123!.</p>

<p>Make sure to check all the licensing before you move forward</p>

<p>After that, just click "Next" through the tabs until you reach the Networking section. There, choose the Virtual Network we created earlier (Active-Directory-Vnet), leave everything else as default, then hit Review and Create to launch the VM.</p>

<h3>Create Virtual Machine for Client-1</h3>

<p>Now we‚Äôre gonna create another VM and call it client-1. Make sure to place it in the same resource group as the domain controller. For the image, choose Windows 10 Pro 22H2, and for the size, go with the same one we used earlier ‚Äî Standard_D2s_v3. Set the username to labuser and the password to Cyberlab123!. After that, just click "Next" through the tabs until you hit the Networking section, select the Virtual Network we created earlier (Active-Directory-Vnet), then hit Review and Create.</p>

<h2>Set dc-1's NIC Private IP address to be static</h2>
<p>After the VM is created, go to the Domain Controller‚Äôs network interface (NIC) settings and set the private IP address to static. We‚Äôre doing this so that dc-1 always keeps the same IP, since it‚Äôs gonna act as the server for Client-1, we don‚Äôt want the IP changing on us.</p>

<h4>Home -> Virtual Machine -> dc-1 -> Network Settings -> Network Interface/IP Configuration </h4>

<h2>Log into the VM and disable the Windows Firewall</h2>

<p>Next up, we‚Äôre gonna log into the dc-1 VM and disable the Windows Firewall, this is just to help with testing connectivity. Normally, you wouldn‚Äôt do this in a real-world setup, but for lab purposes, it makes things easier while we‚Äôre setting everything up.</p>

<p>So now just log into the dc-1 VM using its public IP address. I‚Äôm on a Mac, so I use an app called Microsoft Remote Desktop (Windows App) to connect via RDP. If you‚Äôre on Windows, just open up Remote Desktop, enter the public IP of the VM, and sign in using the credentials we set earlier for dc-1.</p>

<p>Now that we‚Äôre inside the dc-1 VM (our domain controller), we‚Äôre gonna disable the Windows Firewall. To do that, right-click the Start menu, click Run, and type in wf.msc, this will open up the Windows Firewall settings.</p>

<h2>Set Client-1‚Äôs DNS settings to DC-1‚Äôs Private IP address</h2>

<p>Now we‚Äôre gonna set Client-1‚Äôs DNS settings to point to DC-1‚Äôs private IP address. Basically, instead of client-1 using the default Azure or Microsoft DNS servers, we‚Äôre telling it to use our own dc-1 DNS server, which is essential for domain joining to work properly.</p>

<h2>Restart Client-1</h2>

<p>Now, from the Azure Portal, go ahead and restart client-1 so the new DNS settings can take effect properly.</p>

<h2>Login to Client-1</h2>

<p>Now let‚Äôs log in to client-1. Just grab its public IP address from the Azure Portal and paste it into Remote Desktop (or the Windows App if you‚Äôre on a Mac) to connect.</p>


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d37950bc-41f9-40c4-90d5-061ed05b3f60

<h2>Attempt to ping DC-1‚Äôs private IP address</h2>

<p>Once you‚Äôre logged into Client-1, open up PowerShell and try pinging dc-1‚Äôs private IP address(10.0.0.4) to make sure the two machines can talk to each other. If the ping goes through, we‚Äôre good. Then run ipconfig /all in the output, check the DNS settings, and you should see dc-1‚Äôs private IP address listed there. That means the DNS is set up correctly, and we‚Äôre ready to move forward.</p>

<h2>‚úÖ Conclusion ‚Äì Active Directory Setup in Azure</h2>

<p>This concludes the preparation phase of setting up Active Directory in the cloud using Azure. This is just the first step, make sure to continue with Step 2, where we‚Äôll dive into the configuration of Active Directory.</p>
